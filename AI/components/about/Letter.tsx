            <p>Hello Everyone üëã,</p>
            <p>
              Welcome to <strong>BiteBD</strong> ‚Äì a project born out of a desire
              to solve one of the biggest challenges in developing countries like
              <strong> Bangladesh</strong>: <strong>protein deficiency</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many people can‚Äôt afford expensive protein sources like meat and
              fish, which are crucial for their health. BiteBD steps in with
              smart solutions to provide <strong>affordable vegetarian alternatives</strong>
              that are rich in protein and nutrition.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our mission is simple but powerful: <strong>to fight malnutrition</strong>
              and support communities with budget-friendly, healthy food options.
              This initiative aligns with <strong>UN SDG Goal 2: Zero Hunger</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here‚Äôs what BiteBD does:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6">

                Recommends <strong>protein-rich vegetarian foods</strong> that are
                affordable and accessible.
              </li>
              <li>
                Provides <strong>easy-to-follow recipes</strong> to help families
                prepare nutritious meals with locally available ingredients.
              </li>
              <li>
                Offers <strong>personalized meal plans</strong> based on age, weight,
                and budget to ensure everyone gets the nutrition they need.
              </li>
              <li>
                Supports <strong>health education</strong> through an AI-powered chatbot
                assistant that answers questions and guides users.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              By combining <strong>technology</strong>, <strong>data</strong>, and <strong>compassion</strong>,
              BiteBD empowers families to make healthier food choices, improving
              their lives and overall well-being.
            </p>

              This is more than just a project. It‚Äôs a movement to make sure
              everyone, no matter where they live or what they earn, can access
              the nutrition they deserve.
